## Prerequisites

### Check Data Cable

Plug your device into your computer using a USB cable and then do the following:
:::important
You may need to install a driver from Silicon Labs for the [CP210X USB to UART bridge](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

Some newer boards may require the drivers for the [CH9102](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH343SER_ZIP.html) or [Direct Download](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/CH9102_Driver) for Windows 7.

> Connect your Meshtastic device to your USB port, open a `Terminal` and enter the following command:
>
> ```bash
> lsusb
> ```
>
> You should see something like: `ID 10c4:ea60 Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge` for CP210X or `ID 1a86:55d4 QinHeng Electronics USB Single Serial` for CH9102

### Download Latest Firmware

Firmware can be downloaded from the [Firmware](/firmware) page. Your initial installation has to happen over USB from your Mac, Windows or Linux PC. Once our software is installed, all future software updates happen over Bluetooth from your phone.

:::note
The [T-Beam 0.7](../hardware/tbeam-hardware#t-beam---v07) board is an earlier version of the T-Beam board, and due to changes in the design in subsequent iterations this board uses a specific firmware file different from the other T-Beam boards.

`firmware-tbeam0.7-1.x.x.bin` is the correct firmware. `firmware-tbeam-1.x.x.bin` is incompatible. For all other [T-Beam](../hardware/tbeam-hardware) boards `firmware-tbeam-1.x.x.bin` is the correct selection.

### Install Prerequisite Software

> Check if you have `python3` and `pip` installed with the following command
>
> ```bash
> python3 --version
>  pip3 --version
> ```
>
> If `python3` is not installed, install with

> ```
>
> If `pip` is not installed, install with
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install python3-pip
> ```

### Install `esptool`

> ```bash
> pip3 install --upgrade esptool
> ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

### Install Prerequisite Software

> OS X comes with `Python 2.7` installed, but not `pip`. The following uses Homebrew to install `python3` which includes `pip3`. On MacOS you will use `pip3` instead > of `pip`.

:::note
Check if you have Homebrew installed with the following command

```bash
brew -v
```

If it's not installed, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) before continuing.

>
> If `python3` is not installed, install with
> Install Python3
>
> ```bash
> brew install python3
> ```
>
> Confirm `pip3` was installed alongside `python3`
>
> ```bash
> pip3 -v
> ```

### Install `esptool`

> ```bash
> pip3 install --upgrade esptool
> ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

> - Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/). When installing, make sure to click `Add Python X.Y to PATH`.
> - Download and install [Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (or other appropriate shell) and run all subsequent commands from that shell.

:::note
Confirm installation of `python` & `pip` with the following commands.

```bash
py --version
```

```bash
pip --version
```

### Confirm Communication With Chip

Connect the radio to your computer using a data USB cable. Confirm your device is talking to your computer using the following command:

:::important
On windows, you must explicitly declare esptools as a .py script. Use `esptools.py chip_id`.
:::

```bash title="Command"
esptool chip_id
```

```bash title="Expected Output"
# You should see a result similar to this:
mydir$ esptool chip_id

### Navigate to Firmware

`cd` into the directory where you unzipped the latest release. For example:

```bash title="Example"
cd /Downloads/firmware/
```

### Install/Update Firmware

Install or Update the device that you have by using the following commands according to your operating system:

:::caution
Be very careful to install the correct load for your board. In particular the popular 'T-BEAM' radio from TTGO is not called 'TTGO-Lora' (that is a different board). So don't install the 'TTGO-Lora' build on a TBEAM, it won't work correctly.
