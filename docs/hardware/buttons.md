Many of the TTGO Lora32 devices do not have a program button to navigate the displayed pages. It is possible to add a button to the following device:

## TTGO Lora32 V2.1-1.6

Shorting IO12 to ground will progress the screen pages, wake up the device, etc. A simple push switch can be added for this purpose.
