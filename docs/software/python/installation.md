This small library provides a command line interface for Meshtastic nodes and provides an easy API for sending and receiving messages over mesh radios, in addition to changing user settings. Using the command line is currently the most powerful w. Events are delivered using a publish-subscribe model, and you can subscribe to only the message types you are interested in.

[Full documentation](https://meshtastic.github.io/Meshtastic-python) for the library, including examples, is available.

If you wish to view the code or contribute to development of the python library or the command line interface, please visit the Meshtastic python <a href="https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python">GitHub page</a>.

Installation is easily done through the [Python package installer pip](https://pypi.org/project/meshtastic/):
:::note
You must use pip version 20 or later. To upgrade to the latest pip, do: `pip install --upgrade pip`
:::
:::info
Make sure that the `PATH variable` also gets installed by checking the box while installing python. If you don't, python may not be available and you may not be able to call `meshtastic` from your CLI. If you do forget to check that box, you will need to install the path environment variable for python on your operating system.

:::important
You may need to install a driver from Silicon Labs for the [CP210X USB to UART bridge](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

Some newer boards may require the drivers for the [CH9102](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH343SER_ZIP.html) or [Direct Download](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/CH9102_Driver) for Windows 7.

    * If this does not return a version, install pip
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        ```

* Optional: use a python virtual environment (otherwise jump to step "Install pytap2")
    * Install python-virtualenvwrapper (arch based distros as an example)
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -Syu python-virtualenvwrapper
        ```
    * Create a virtual environment
        ```bash
        source /usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
        mkvirtualenv meshtastic
        workon meshtastic
        ```

:::note 
Be aware that the Meshtastic CLI is not able to control the nodes over USB through termux, but you can control devices over Wifi using the `--host x.x.x.x` option with the device IP address. However, only ESP32 devices can use Wifi currently.
