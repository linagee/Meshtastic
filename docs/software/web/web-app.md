The Meshtastic firmware incorporates an embedded web server using the [ESP32 HTTPS Server](https://github.com/fhessel/esp32_https_server) project. This allows the Wifi supporting ESP32 devices to run our web interface to access Meshtastic directly from your browser. This imports the [Meshtastic.js library](/docs/software/js/getting-started) to provide a web page capable of interacting with the device.
