If you have opted-in to analytics on the Android app (thank you - that helps us know what things we need to improve), we will receive anonymized information about user behavior.  This includes crash reports,  which screens you used in the app etc... Analytics is provided by [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics).

We never capture usernames, the contents of your texts or your location.
