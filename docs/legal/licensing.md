You are hereby granted a two-year non-exclusive license to use the Meshtastic® logo and trademark on your product/project. No fee is required for this usage, though if you wish keeping $1/unit set-aside so that it can eventually fund [meshtastic.org](https://meshtastic.org) it would be appreciated.

We only ask that you include a line in your support text that states:

> Meshtastic® is a registered trademark of Geeksville Industries LLC. Meshtastic software components are released under various licenses, see GitHub for details. No warranty is provided - use at your own risk.
